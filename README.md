# Behavioral Patterns (9)
## 1. Memento
Allows restoring an object to a previous state.
## 2. State
Allows an object to behave differently depending on the state it is in.
## 3. Iterator
Allows iterating over an object without having to expose the objectâ€™s internal structure (which may change in the future).
## 4. Strategy
Allows passing different algorithms (behaviours) to an object.Allows defining a template (skeleton) for an operation. Specific steps will then be implemented in subclasses.
## 5. Command
Allows decouple a sender from a receiver. The sender will talk to the receive through a command. Commands can be undone and persisted.
## 6. Observer
Allows an object notify other objects when its state changes.
## 7. Mediator
Allows an object to encapsulate the communication between other objects.
## 8. Chain of Responsibility
Allows building a chain of objects to process a request.
## 9. Visitor
Allows adding new operations to an object structure without modifying it.
